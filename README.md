# Hexapod-PCB
### 4-Layer PCB for the Arduino Hexapod

## Introduction
This PCB is a 4-Layer hexapod for servo applications. It containes a signal layer for all the servo pwm pins and a uniform ground + power plane for the servos spesifically. The reason while I decided to go through this project is because I wanted a way that I can adjust the voltage level of the servos as depending on the voltage of the servos the speed and tourque is affected. This also will organize my wire managment by a lot since I don't have to extrapolate my electonics to a bunch of breadboards.
